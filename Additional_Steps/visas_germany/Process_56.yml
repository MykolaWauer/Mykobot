  - 'Do you have a Residence document-GB and have you received a new passport?


    Then (only) the plastic card of your Residence document-GB is no longer valid,
    since this plastic card refers to your old passport. However, your residence title
    Residence document-GB is still valid.


    Please read the following notes before booking an appointment.


    Is your temporary Residence document-GB only valid for a maximum of a further
    6 months?

    If so, please do not attend the Berlin Immigration Office before it is neccessary
    to extend your Residence document-GB. This will save you time and money.


    Are you wanting to travel abroad?

    If no appointments are available at short notice, you can still travel abroad.

    Re-entry to Germany is easy, if your Residence document-GB residence permit is
    still valid and you still have the old passport.

    Take your old and new passports and your Residence document-GB with you on your
    trip.

    However, we recommend that you enquire about the entry and exit conditions of
    the country you are visiting before you travel abroad (for example at the embassy
    of the country you are visiting).'
