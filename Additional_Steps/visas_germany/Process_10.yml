- - Tell me something about RESIDENCE PERMIT FOR THE RECOGNITION OF A FOREIGN PROFESSIONAL
    QUALIFICATION IN A NON-REGULATED PROFESSION
  - 'Are you are a foreign skilled worker who wishes to work in Germany in a non-regulated
    profession and also already have a concrete job offer?

    But your professional qualification has not yet been fully recognised by the competent
    body in Germany because there are still practical deficiencies?


    If so, as a rule you will be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose
    of working in your profession in Germany so that the practical deficiencies can
    be made up for and you can obtain confirmation from the competent body of the
    equivalence of your foreign professional qualification.


    The temporary residence permit will be granted for the duration of your employment
    contract and for a maximum of up to two years.


    Upon the successful completion of the measure you may be granted a further temporary
    residence permit, particularly for the purpose of job-seeking or for employment
    as a qualified skilled worker.'
