    \ for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) or are a recognised refugee according to the\
    \ Geneva Refugee Convention?Have you been admitted by Germany as a resettlement\
    \ refugee?Then you are usually granted a permanent settlement permit after a residence\
    \ of 5 years. If you are well integrated linguistically and economically, you\
    \ may be granted a permanent settlement permit after a residence of only 3 years.\n\

    \ may also be granted a permanent settlement permit after a residence of 5 years,\
