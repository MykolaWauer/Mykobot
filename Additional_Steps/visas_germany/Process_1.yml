  - 'Schengen visas (visa category C) can be issued for short-term stays of up to
    90 days in the Schengen region, for instance, for tourist visits or visits for
    business purposes or for medical treatment. The consulates of the Schengen States
    are responsible for granting Schengen visas.


    An extension to a Schengen visa is only possible:

    entry into the Federal Republic of Germany or into another Schengen state was
    late.A Schengen visa which has already expired cannot by extended.'
