- - Tell me something about RESIDENCE PERMIT FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT
  - 'You can be issued with a residence permit on a temporary basis if your medical
    treatment in Germany lasts longer than the term of validity of the national visa
    (type D) issued to you for this purpose.


    The residence permit can also be issued for your accompanying persons to whom
    a national visa (type D) was issued for this purpose.


    As a rule, the residence permit cannot be extended if the medical treatment is
    finished.


    If you have a Schengen visa (type C), you cannot receive a residence permit. However,
    you can extend your Schengen visa as a national visa (type D). You can find out
    more about this in the service "Schengen-Visa extension" (see section "More information").'
