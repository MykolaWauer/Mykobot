  - 'Do you have a residence permit for the purpose of employment or an EU Blue Card?Does
    your work permit specify a particular company?Do you want to change company?Then
    please apply to have your residence permit for the purpose of employment or EU
    Blue Card amended. Please note, however, before our instructions.


    Note: Your residence permit for the purpose of employment/your EU Blue Card does
    not have to be amended, if you


    have already worked for at least two years with a residence permit for the purpose
    of employment oryou have resided continuously in Germany for at least three years
    with a residence permit (except for study)and

    in addition, no time limit is fixed by law for your type of employment (such as,
    for example, in the case of speciality chefs or within the framework of an exchange
    of personnel of an internationally operating company).

    You can then move to another skilled employment without prior approval. The Foreigners
    Registration Office will provide you with written confirmation of this on request.


    Do you still work for the same employer, but something has changed, for example
    the name of the company or of your job? Also in this case your residence permit
    EU does not need to be changed. Then please read our "fact sheet for foreign workers"
    (see below in section "More information").'
