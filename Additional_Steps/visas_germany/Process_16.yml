  - "Granting and extension of a residence permit for the purpose of research\n\n\
    Directive (EU) 2016/801 states that a residence permit for the purpose of research\
    \ will be granted if a valid hosting agreement or suitable contract is concluded\
    \ with a research institution in the federal territory.\nThe residence permit\
    \ is usually granted for the period of the research project, but for not longer\
    \ than 3 years.\nResidence permits are granted for 1 year respectively and then\
    \ extended in the case of research institutions that are not recognised by the\
    \ Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) according to the Residence\
    \ Act (AufenthG).\n\nThe residence permit also allows work as a teacher or in\
    \ a self-employed capacity.\n\nAt the end of the research project, the residence\
    \ permit is extended for 9 months. This enables the person to seek alternative\
    \ gainful employment that reflects their qualifications.\n\nFor short residencies\
    \ for research purposes lasting not longer than 1 year:\nDo you hold a valid residence\
    \ permit for research purposes from another EU Member State according to Directive\
    \ (EU) 2016/801? Would you like to conduct research at a research institution\
    \ in Germany that will not involve you residing in the federal territory for longer\
    \ than 180 days over a period of 360 days ? If so, you do not require a German\
    \ residence permit for your short-term period of research.\nDo you hold a valid\
    \ residence permit from another EU Member State according to Directive (EU) 2016/801\
    \ to work as a researcher, student, volunteer, au pair or intern? Would you like\
    \ to conduct research at a research institution in Germany that will involve you\
    \ residing in the federal territory for longer than 180 days but not more than\
    \ one year ? If so, you will be granted a residence permit as a mobile researcher.For\
    \ more information about the terms and requirements for these two cases, refer\
    \ to the section \u201CMore information\u201D."
