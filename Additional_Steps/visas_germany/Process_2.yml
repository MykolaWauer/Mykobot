    VISA)
  - "If you invite a foreign visitor to Germany for a short time, you can submit a\
    \ declaration of commitment for your visitor. Your visitor needs such a declaration\
    \ of commitment in particular if he/she is applying for a short-stay visa and\
    \ cannot pay for the cost of his/her stay in Germany himself/herself. The declaration\
    \ of commitment is generally recognised by German missions abroad for up to 6\
    \ months after it has been issued.\n\nWhat is a short-stay visa?\nWith a short-stay\
    \ visa, your visitor can stay in Germany for up to 90 days within a period of\
    \ 180 days. It is valid for private visits, tourist trips and business trips.\
    \ It is also called a \"Schengen visa\" or \"tourist visa\". You can find out\
    \ more about the short-stay visa on the website of the Federal Foreign Office\
    \ (see \"Further Information\u201D section).\n\nWhat costs are involved?\nWith\
    \ the declaration, you undertake to bear all the costs that the state might incur\
    \ as a result of your visitor's stay in Germany. These include:\nCost of living\
    \ (for example, for food and drink, accommodation, clothing, medical treatment,\
    \ medication or nursing care)Costs which arise in the event that the authorities\
    \ have to send your visitor back to his/her home country under compulsion.For\
    \ more information on the scope and duration of the commitment, please refer to\
    \ the \"Zusatzerkl\xE4rung zur Verpflichtungserkl\xE4rung (Additional declaration\
    \ of commitment)\" (see \"Forms\" section)."
