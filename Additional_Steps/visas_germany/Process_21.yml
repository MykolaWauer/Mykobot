  - "If you have a university degree you can get an EU Blue Card to enable you to\
    \ work in Germany. A certain minimum salary is necessary for this.\n\nThe EU Blue\
    \ Card has several advantages compared with a residence permit for the purpose\
    \ of employment. For example, it enables you to obtain the right of permanent\
    \ residence more quickly. There is more information about the benefits in the\
    \ \u201CMore information\u201D section.\n\nThe EU Blue Card is valid for a maximum\
    \ of 4 years. If you have a fixed-term employment contract, the EU Blue Card can\
    \ also be valid for a shorter time. Normally it also lasts 3 months longer than\
    \ your employment contract.\n\nFor the first two years of employment, approval\
    \ from the Foreigners\u2019 Registration Office must be obtained before any change\
    \ of job.\n\nYou have foreign family members in Berlin who also need a residence\
    \ title?\nThen please make an appointment together to apply for the EU Blue Card\
    \ and the residence permits for your family members.\nYou can find the necessary\
    \ documents for your family members in the service \"Residence permit for spouses\
    \ and children of holders of an EU Blue Card\" (see section \"More information\"\
    )."
