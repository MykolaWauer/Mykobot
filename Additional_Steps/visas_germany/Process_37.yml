    This right can be granted if the person spent many years lawfully residing in
    the federal territory as a minor.


    The application for a temporary residence permit must be filed after the person
    reaches the age of 15 and before he or she reaches the age of 21, as well as within
    five years of departure from the federal territory.


    Simplified requirements shall apply to foreigners who have been forced into marriage
    by means of violence or threat and have been prevented from returning to Germany.'
