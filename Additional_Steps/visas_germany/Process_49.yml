    GERMANY) AND EEA CITIZENS
  - 'Please note: This service is not available for family members (spouses, parents,
    children) of German citizens. If you are a family member of a German citizen,
    please inform yourself about the "Residence permit for spouses, parents and children
    of German citizens" (see section "More information").


    Family members subject to the law on freedom of movement of a citizen of the EU
    or of the EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) who themselves are not citizens
    of the EU or EAA officially receive a residence card for five years within six
    months after they have furnished the required information. The residence card
    evidences their right to entry and residence deriving from the freedom of movement
    rights accorded to citizens of the EU or of the EAA.


    If a residence card cannot be issued immediately to a citizen of the EU or EAA
    at the time of the appointment, e.g. because documents are still missing, an informal
    application certificate will be issued. This certificate is valid for six months
    from the month of issue.


    Family members of other foreign or German citizens receive neither a residence
    card nor an application certificate.'
