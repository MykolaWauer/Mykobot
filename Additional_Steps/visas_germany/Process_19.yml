  - "A residence permit may be issued for work at a legally regulated national voluntary\
    \ service or the European Voluntary Service.\n\nThe residence permit is issued\
    \ for the duration of participation, generally for 12 months. In principle, the\
    \ work with the voluntary service must be full-time. Other employment or self-employed\
    \ activities are not permissible with this residence permit.\n\nDiffering requirements\
    \ apply for the individual voluntary services.\n\nYouth Volunteer Service (JFD)\n\
    This includes the Voluntary Social Year (FSJ) and the Voluntary Ecological Year\
    \ (F\xD6J). These national voluntary services also offer youths and young adults\
    \ from abroad the opportunity to engage in civic activities in Germany.\nParticipation\
    \ in a Youth Volunteer Service must be for a minimum of 6 months and can be extended\
    \ to up to 24 months in exceptional circumstances.\nWhen the requirements are\
    \ met, a residence permit can be issued.\n\nFederal Volunteer Service (BFD)\n\
    The BFD offers all generations the opportunity to get involved in various social\
    \ areas once compulsory education has been completed. Participation in the BFD\
    \ can be shortened to 6 months or extended to up to 18 months.\nWhen the requirements\
    \ are met, a residence permit can be issued.\n\nEuropean Voluntary Service (EVS)\n\
    The EVS is part of the Youth in Action programme under the Erasmus+ umbrella.\
    \ Fields of engagement include the social, youth, environment and cultural fields.\n\
    Participation is for a period of up to 12 months.\nIf participation in the EVS\
    \ is for more than 90 days, a residence permit will be granted if requirements\
    \ are fulfilled. A residence permit is not necessary for shorter stays."
