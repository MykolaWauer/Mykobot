- - Tell me something about RESIDENCE PERMIT TO TAKE PART IN A STUDENT EXCHANGE OR
    TO ATTEND SCHOOL
  - 'A temporary residence permit may be issued for school attendance or for participation
    in a pupil exchange.

    As a rule, a temporary residence permit for school attendance is possible from
    the 9th class. For a pupil exchange, residence may also be enabled for lower class
    levels.


    Attending school lessons does not entitle the student to a residence permit for
    this purpose.'
