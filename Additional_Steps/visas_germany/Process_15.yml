    has up to now held a residence permit for gainful employment or under Article
    16e of the German Residence Act (study-related internship EU):The temporary residence
    permit may be issued for six months if the skilled worker has a command of the
    German language sufficient for the work he seeks.

    has up to now held a residence permit for gainful employment or under Article
    16e of the German Residence Act (study-related internship EU):The temporary residence

    issued for nine months.


    e) After the successful completion of qualified vocational training in German
    territory with a residence permit under Article 16a of the German Residence Act:The
    residence permit is issued for 12 months.


    f) After the establishment of the equivalence of the professional qualification
    or the issuance a professional practice permit in German territory with a temporary
    residence permit under Article 16d of the German Residence Act:The residence permit
    is issued for 12 months.


    Please also note:

    In cases a) and b) the temporary residence permit confers a right to engage, for
    a maximum of 10 hours per week, in trial employment for which the skilled worker
    is qualified. Work on a self-employed basis is not permitted.In the other cases
    engagement in any gainful employment is permitted.An extension of this temporary
    residence permit is excluded if no appropriate gainful employment could be found
    within the validity period.A new residence permit may only be issued for engagement
    in appropriate gainful employment or in the event of a statutory entitlement.'
