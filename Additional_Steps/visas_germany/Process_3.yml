    VISA)
  - 'As a rule, a national visa for entry for a long-term stay (more than 90 stays)
    can only be issued if subsistence costs during the stay in the Federal Republic
    of Germany are assured.


    If sufficient own funds cannot be proven when applying for a national visa at
    the German mission abroad (embassy or consulate general), persons living in Berlin
    with sufficient creditworthiness can make a declaration of commitment for the
    applicant at the Berlin Immigration Office.


    The commitment includes bearing all subsistence costs. This includes for example
    the costs for housing or in the event of illness.


    In addition, public funds for subsistence costs spent by an issuing authority
    (for example the Social Welfare office) must be reimbursed.


    The declaration of commitment lasts for 5 years. This period starts with entry
    into the Federal Republic of Germany, if this is made possible by the declaration
    of commitment.


    A declaration of commitment at the Berlin Immigration Office is only possible
    for certain long-term purposes of residence, for example studying or marriage.


    Would you like to submit a declaration of commitment within the admission programm
    for Syrian and Iraqi refugees with relatives in Berlin? Then please refer to the
    "More information" section.'
