- - Tell me something about RESIDENCE PERMIT FOR FOREIGNERS WITH A LONG-TERM RESIDENCE
    IN AN EU MEMBER STATE
  - "Foreigners who are entitled to posses the legal status of a long-term resident\
    \ in an EU member state will be granted a residence permit if their stay within\
    \ the territory of the Federal Republic shall last longer than three months.\n\
    \nForeigners entitled to long-term residence are those who hold a residence permit\
    \ (under EU Directive 2003/109/EG of 25.11.2003) bearing the designation \"permanent\
    \ residence EG\" or \"permanent residence EU\" in the respective official language\
    \ of the issuing EU member state.\n\nExcluded from this are holders of a residence\
    \ title issued by Great Britain, Denmark and Ireland, since these EU member states\
    \ do not apply the corresponding EU directive 2003/109/EG dated 25.11.2003.\n\n\
    The general prerequisites for issuing a German residence permit, such as a secure\
    \ livelihood, apply without restriction.\n\nThe residence permit allows gainful\
    \ employment dependent upon the predominant purpose for which the residence shall\
    \ serve (e.g. studies, employment, self-employed activity). The \xA7\xA7 16-21\
    \ of the residence law shall be applied analogously."
