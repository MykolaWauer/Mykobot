    ACADEMIC EDUCATION
  - 'Issuance or extension of a temporary residence permit for skilled workers with
    an academic qualification who wish to pursue qualified employment for which they
    are qualified due to their studies.


    The temporary residence permit is issued for up to four years. If the employment
    contract has a shorter term or if the approval of the Federal Employment Agency
    is limited to a shorter period, in an individual case the temporary residence
    permit will be issued for less than four years and extended.'
