    \ for foreign nationals:\nForeign nationals from non-EU countries can be issued\
    \ with a German substitute passport in the form of a travel document for foreign\
    \ nationals in the case that it is not reasonably possible to obtain from the\
    \ authorities of the country of origin a passport or substitute passport.If the\
