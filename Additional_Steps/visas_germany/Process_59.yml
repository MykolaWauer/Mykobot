- - Tell me something about TRANSFER OF A PERMANENT SETTLEMENT PERMIT OR AN EU LONG-TERM
    RESIDENCE PERMIT TO A NEW PASSPORT
  - 'Do you have a permanent settlement permit or an EU long-term residence permit
    and have you received a new passport?

    Then you should have your permanent residence title reissued ("transferred").
    Because your current permanent residence title still refers to the old passport.


    If you want to travel abroad before the permanent residence title has been transferred:

    If no appointments are available at short notice, it is possible to start a trip
    abroad even without a transfer, if you have your old passport and your residence
    title. You will be able to return to Germany without any problems, if you take
    your new passport, the old passport and your permanent residence title with you.

    However, it is recommended that you check the entry and exit conditions of the
    host country before traveling abroad (e.g. at the consular authority of the host
    country).'
