  - 'Do you have a valid residence permit and have you received a new passport?

    Then you should have your residence permit reissued ("transferred"). Because your
    current residence permit still refers to the old passport.


    Please read the following notes before booking an appointment.


    Is your residence permit only valid for a maximum of a further 6 months?

    If so, please do not attend the Berlin Immigration Office before it is neccessary
    to extend your residence permit. This will save you time and money.


    Are you wanting to travel abroad?

    If no appointments are available at short notice, you can still travel abroad.

    Re-entry to Germany is easy, if your residence permit is still valid and you still
    have the old passport.

    Take your old and new passports and your residence permit with you on your trip.

    However, we recommend that you enquire about the entry and exit conditions of
    the country you are visiting before you travel abroad (for example at the embassy
    of the country you are visiting).'
