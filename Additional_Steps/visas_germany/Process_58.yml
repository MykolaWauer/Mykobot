  - 'Do you have an EU Blue Card and have you received a new passport?


    Then (only) the plastic card of your EU Blue Card residence permit is no longer
    valid, since this plastic card refers to your old passport. However, your residence
    title EU Blue Card is still valid.


    Please read the following notes before booking an appointment.


    Is your EU Blue Card only valid for a maximum of a further 6 months?

    If so, please do not attend the Berlin Immigration Office before it is neccessary
    to extend your EU Blue Card. This will save you time and money.


    Are you wanting to travel abroad?

    If no appointments are available at short notice, you can still travel abroad.

    Re-entry to Germany is easy, if your EU Blue Card residence permit is still valid
    and you still have the old passport.

    Take your old and new passports and your EU Blue Card with you on your trip.

    However, we recommend that you enquire about the entry and exit conditions of
    the country you are visiting before you travel abroad (for example at the embassy
    of the country you are visiting).'
