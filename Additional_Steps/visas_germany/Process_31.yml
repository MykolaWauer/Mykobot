  - 'Extension of a residence permit issued on humanitarian grounds, e.g. pursuant
    to section 23 or section 25 of the Residence Act.


    A residence permit under section 23 must have been issued by order of the State
    of Berlin or of the Federal ministry.


    Compelling humanitarian grounds for the issue of the residence permit pursuant
    to section 25 can be:

    Recognition as being entitled to asylum or as a refugee by the Federal Office
    for Migration and Refugees,application of a deportation ban or an obstacle to
    departure orundue hardship.

    Depending on the legal basis for the issuing of a residence permit on humanitarian
    grounds the documents and fees required may vary.'
