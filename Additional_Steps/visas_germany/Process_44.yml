    worker, you may be granted a permanent settlement permit after 4 years.


    If you have completed vocational training or a degree in Germany, this is already
    possible after 2 years of employment as a qualified skilled worker.


    Do you have an EU Blue Card?

    Then other requirements apply. Please inform yourself in the service "Permanent
    settlement permit for EU Blue Card holders" (see section "More information").'
