    QUALIFICATION IN CONNECTION WITH A QUALIFICATION MEASURE
  - 'Are you a foreign skilled worker who wishes to work in Germany but your professional
    qualifications have not yet been fully recognised by the competent body in Germany?


    If so you will usually be granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose
    of completing qualification measures and examinations in order to make up for
    technical, practical and linguistic deficiencies and thus obtain

    recognition of your professional qualification (establishment of the equivalence
    to a domestic professional qualification),the issuance of the professional practice
    permit (occupational access) orpermission to use the professional title.

    The qualification measures include offers from vocational or technical colleges,
    company or supra-company offers with practical and theoretical components, preparatory
    courses for knowledge or aptitude examinations as well as general or occupation-oriented
    language courses.


    The temporary residence permit is granted for the specific duration of the respective
    qualification measure and as a maximum for up to a total of two years.


    Upon successful completion of the qualification measure a further temporary residence
    permit may be granted, particularly for the purpose of job-seeking or for employment
    as a skilled worker.'
