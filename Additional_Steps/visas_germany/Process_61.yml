  - "A fictional certificate is issued when it is not yet possible to decide on an\
    \ application for a residence permit, e.g. because\ndocuments are missing or the\
    \ foreigner's file is not available,an electronically applied for residence permit\
    \ (eRP) cannot be issued prior to expiry of the currently valid residence permit\
    \ orthe outcome of punishable offence proceedings is still outstanding.\nA fictional\
    \ certificate may only be issued when residence is still lawful at the time of\
    \ applying for the issue or renewal of a residence permit.\n\nIf a currently valid\
    \ residence permit (temporary residence permit or national visa for long-term\
    \ durations - Category D - ) is available, a fictional certificate according to\
    \ \xA7 81 Section 4 of the Residence Act will be issued.\nIn this case, the residence\
    \ permit and all supplementary regulations (also regarding the stipulations concerning\
    \ gainful employment) remain in force until a decision has been made in relation\
    \ to the application. Journeys abroad and re-entry into the area of the Republic\
    \ are possible with a valid fictional certificate in accordance with \xA7 81 Section\
    \  4 of the Residence Act.\n\nIf the male or female applicant is lawfully resident\
    \ without a visa in the Federal Republic, because he or she is entitled to be\
    \ by virtue of his/her nationality, the fictional certificate will be issued in\
    \ accordance with \xA7 81 Section 3 of the Residence Act.\nThis permits residence\
    \ in the area of the Federal Republic until a decision has been made regarding\
    \ the application. This fictional certification, however, does not permit re-entry\
    \ into the territory of the Federal Republic.  It also does not permit the commencement\
    \ of gainful employment.\n\nA fictional certificate cannot be issued to holders\
    \ of a Schengen visa for short-term residence (Category C)."
