    \                   A child does not become eligible to obtain a permanent settlement\
    \ permit until it has reached the age of 16.\n\nForeigners who have reached the\
    \ age of majority may also receive a permanent settlement permit on this basis,\
    \ provided they travelled to the federal territory to join their family and the\
    \ first issue of a temporary residence permit was before they reached the age\
    \ of 18.                                \n\n\n\n                             \

    \ attendance,company apprenticeship,degree course.Vocational preparation, basic\
    \ vocational training or an internship do not lead to a recognised professional\

    \ its subsistence must be ensured without public benefits according to the Social\
    \ Code II or XI (citizen\u2019s benefit (B\xFCrgergeld) or social welfare).  \
