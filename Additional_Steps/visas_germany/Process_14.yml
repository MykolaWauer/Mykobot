    TRAINING
  - 'Issuance or extension of a temporary residence permit for qualified skilled workers
    without an academic qualification who wish to engage in qualified employment for
    which they are qualified due to their vocational training.


    The residence permit is issued for up to four years. If the employment contract
    has a shorter term or if the approval of the Federal Employment Agency is limited
    to a shorter period, in an individual case the temporary residence permit will
    be issued for less than four years and extended.'
