  - 'UK nationals require a residence title or other proof of their right of residence
    in order to stay in Germany.


    If UK nationals and their family members moved to Germany by 31.12.2020, they
    derive a right of residence from EU law. In that case more generous conditions
    apply.


    You will be issued with a GB residence document ex officio. This is generally
    valid for 10 years and certifies your right of entry and residence. With this
    document you are entitled to exercise all forms of economic activity (employment
    or self-employed activities).'
